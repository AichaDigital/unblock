# ⚠️ SECURITY WARNING ⚠️
# We do NOT exclude test directories completely - they should be scanned!
# Only specific, documented test passwords are ignored below.

# IMPORTANT: Never use real passwords, API keys, or credentials in tests!
# Always use clearly marked fake data with "Test" prefix or similar.

# Paths to ignore - MINIMAL exclusions only
paths-ignore:
  - tests/stubs/**/*  # Only stub files, not actual tests

# Paths to always scan (override ignore rules)
paths-scan:
  - app/**
  - config/**
  - routes/**
  - tests/**  # YES, we scan tests to catch real secrets!

# Matches to ignore (ONLY specific documented test passwords)
# Each entry must be:
# 1. Clearly marked as test data (with "Test" prefix)
# 2. Documented why it's safe
# 3. Visible in code with // ggignore comment
