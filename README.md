**Unblock** is a web-based firewall management system designed specifically for hosting providers. It simplifies firewall log analysis and IP unblocking for both administrators and clients, with a focus on usability for non-technical users.

## ✨ Features

- **🔍 IP Analysis**: Comprehensive firewall log analysis across multiple services (CSF, DirectAdmin BFM, Exim, Dovecot, ModSecurity)
- **🚀 One-Click Unblock**: Automated IP unblocking with intelligent detection
- **👥 Multi-User Management**: Support for hosting clients, resellers, and VPS owners
- **📧 Email Notifications**: Detailed reports sent to users and administrators
- **🔐 Authorized Users**: Delegate access to specific domains/servers without full account access
- **🔄 WHMCS Integration**: Optional automatic synchronization with WHMCS
- **🌍 Multi-Panel Support**: Works with cPanel and DirectAdmin
- **📊 Detailed Reports**: Comprehensive firewall logs with explanations
- **🔒 Security First**: All actions logged, IP validation, SSH key management
- **🌐 Internationalization**: Full support for English and Spanish

## 📋 Requirements

- **PHP**: 8.3 or higher
- **Laravel**: 12.x
- **Database**: SQLite (recommended) or MySQL 8.0+
- **Web Server**: Nginx or Apache
- **Node.js**: 18+ (for asset compilation)
- **SSH Access**: To managed servers running CSF/DirectAdmin

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Clone and Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AichaDigital/unblock.git
cd unblock
composer install
npm install && npm run build
```

### 2. Environment Setup

```bash
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
```

### 3. Configure Company Information

Edit `.env` and configure your company details:

```env
COMPANY_NAME="Your Hosting Company"
SUPPORT_EMAIL=support@yourcompany.com
SUPPORT_URL=https://support.yourcompany.com

# Legal URLs (Required for GDPR compliance)
LEGAL_PRIVACY_URL=https://yourcompany.com/privacy
LEGAL_TERMS_URL=https://yourcompany.com/terms
LEGAL_DATA_PROTECTION_URL=https://yourcompany.com/data-protection
```

### 4. Database Setup

```bash
# For SQLite (recommended)
touch database/database.sqlite
php artisan migrate --seed

# For MySQL, configure DB_* variables in .env first
```

### 5. Create Admin User

```bash
php artisan tinker
```

```php
App\Models\User::create([
    'first_name' => 'Admin',
    'last_name' => 'System',
    'email' => 'admin@yourcompany.com',
    'password' => bcrypt('your-secure-password'),
    'is_admin' => true,
]);
```

### 6. Start Development Server

```bash
php artisan serve
```

Visit `http://localhost:8000` and log in with your admin credentials.

## 📖 Documentation

### Adding Servers (Hosts)

1. Go to Admin Panel → Hosts
2. Add your server details:
   - **FQDN**: Server hostname
   - **IP Address**: Server IP
   - **SSH User**: Usually `root`
   - **Panel Type**: `cpanel` or `directadmin`
3. Upload SSH key (see SSH Key Setup below)

### SSH Key Setup

For security, create a restricted SSH key that can only execute specific CSF commands:

```bash
# On your Unblock server
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/unblock_csf -C "unblock-firewall"

# Copy public key to managed server
cat ~/.ssh/unblock_csf.pub
```

On the managed server, add to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` with command restriction:

```bash
command="/path/to/restricted-csf-wrapper.sh",no-port-forwarding,no-X11-forwarding,no-agent-forwarding ssh-ed25519 AAAA... unblock-firewall
```

See [docs/ssh-keys-setup.md](docs/ssh-keys-setup.md) for detailed instructions and wrapper script.

### WHMCS Integration (Optional)

To sync users and hostings from WHMCS:

```env
WHMCS_SYNC_ENABLED=true
WHMCS_API_URL=https://your-whmcs.com/includes/api.php
WHMCS_API_IDENTIFIER=your_api_identifier
WHMCS_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
```

See [docs/whmcs-integration.md](docs/whmcs-integration.md) for complete setup.

### Authorized Users

Allow clients to grant access to specific domains without sharing their account:

1. Client creates authorized user in their dashboard
2. Assign specific domain(s) or server(s)
3. Authorized user receives OTP login access
4. Can only see/manage assigned resources

## 🔧 Configuration

### Queue Workers

For production, configure queue workers using Supervisor:

```bash
sudo cp supervisor-laravel-worker.conf /etc/supervisor/conf.d/unblock-worker.conf
# Edit paths in the file
sudo supervisorctl reread
sudo supervisorctl update
sudo supervisorctl start unblock-worker:*
```

### Scheduled Tasks

Add to crontab:

```bash
* * * * * cd /path/to/unblock && php artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1
```

## 🧪 Testing

Run the complete test suite:

```bash
composer test

# With coverage
composer test:coverage

# Parallel execution
php artisan test --parallel
```

## 🔒 Security

- **SSH Keys**: Use dedicated, restricted SSH keys for firewall operations
- **Input Validation**: All IPs and commands are validated and sanitized
- **Action Logging**: All firewall actions are logged with user context
- **WHMCS**: Create read-only MySQL user for WHMCS integration
- **Session Timeout**: 4-hour inactivity timeout
- **OTP Authentication**: Time-based OTP for client access

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for security best practices.

## 🌍 Internationalization

Unblock supports multiple languages out of the box:

- **English** (en)
- **Spanish** (es)

To add more languages, copy `lang/en` to your language code and translate the strings.
