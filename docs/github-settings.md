# GitHub Repository Settings Guide

This document explains the recommended GitHub settings for the Unblock project.

## üîí Branch Protection Rules

### Protecting the `main` Branch

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: Branch protection rules must be configured via GitHub web interface, as they cannot be set via CLI for free/personal accounts.

To configure branch protection:

1. Go to: https://github.com/AichaDigital/unblock/settings/branches
2. Click "Add branch protection rule"
3. Branch name pattern: `main`
4. Enable these settings:

#### Required Settings
- ‚úÖ **Require a pull request before merging**
  - Require approvals: 1 (or more for team projects)
  - Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed
  - Require review from Code Owners (optional, if you have a CODEOWNERS file)

- ‚úÖ **Require status checks to pass before merging**
  - Require branches to be up to date before merging
  - Status checks required:
    - `quality` (from CI workflow)
    - Or all checks if you add more workflows

- ‚úÖ **Require conversation resolution before merging**
  - Ensures all review comments are addressed

- ‚úÖ **Require signed commits** (Recommended)
  - Ensures commits are cryptographically signed

- ‚úÖ **Include administrators**
  - Apply rules to repository administrators too
  - **Important**: This prevents even you from accidentally pushing directly to main

#### Optional but Recommended
- ‚úÖ **Require linear history**
  - Forces use of rebase or squash merge
  - Keeps commit history clean

- ‚úÖ **Do not allow bypassing the above settings**
  - Ensures protection rules are always enforced

- ‚ùå **Allow force pushes** - Keep DISABLED
- ‚ùå **Allow deletions** - Keep DISABLED

### Additional Branches to Protect

If you create `develop` or `staging` branches, apply similar rules.
