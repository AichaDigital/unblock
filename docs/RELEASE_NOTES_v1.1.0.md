# Release Notes - Unblock v1.1.0

**Release Date:** October 21, 2025  
**Branch:** `feature/onlyIp`  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Ready for Production

---

## üéØ Overview

Version 1.1.0 introduces **Simple Unblock Mode**, a major new feature that enables anonymous IP unblocking without authentication. This feature is designed for hosting providers with tightly-coupled client relationships who need a streamlined, secure way to allow clients to unblock themselves.

---

## üöÄ What's New

### Simple Unblock Mode (Anonymous IP Unblocking)

A complete new workflow that allows users to unblock their IP addresses without logging in:

#### Key Features:
- ‚úÖ **No authentication required** - Public-facing form accessible to anyone
- ‚úÖ **Cross-validation security** - Only unblocks if BOTH IP is blocked AND domain exists in server logs
- ‚úÖ **IP autodetection** - Automatically detects user's IP address
- ‚úÖ **Domain normalization** - Handles www prefixes and case variations
- ‚úÖ **Aggressive rate limiting** - 3 requests/minute by IP (configurable)
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive logging** - All attempts logged via Spatie Activity Log
- ‚úÖ **Email notifications** - Notifies users and administrators
- ‚úÖ **Multi-panel support** - Works with both cPanel and DirectAdmin
- ‚úÖ **Bilingual** - Full support for English and Spanish

#### How It Works:
1. User visits `/simple-unblock` (when enabled)
2. Enters IP (autodetected), domain, and email
3. System validates:
   - IP is actually blocked in firewall
   - Domain exists in server logs (Apache/Nginx/Exim)
4. If both conditions match ‚Üí Unblock + Email notification
5. If conditions don't match ‚Üí Generic response (prevents enumeration)

## üîß Technical Implementation

### New Components

#### Actions
- `SimpleUnblockAction` - Domain validation and job dispatching

#### Jobs
- `ProcessSimpleUnblockJob` - Core processing with cross-validation
- `SendSimpleUnblockNotificationJob` - Async email notifications

#### Livewire
- `SimpleUnblockForm` - Public form with IP autodetection

#### Middleware
- `ThrottleSimpleUnblock` - IP-based rate limiting

#### Services
- `AnonymousUserService` - Singleton for anonymous user management

#### Mail
- `SimpleUnblockNotificationMail` - Email templates for users and admins

#### Database
- `AnonymousUserSeeder` - Creates system anonymous user

## üîê Security Considerations

### What's Protected:

1. **Enumeration Prevention**
   - Generic responses for all failure cases
   - No distinction between "IP not blocked" vs "domain not found"
   
2. **Abuse Prevention**
   - Cross-validation (must own domain AND be blocked)
   - Cache locking (10-minute cooldown per IP+domain)
   - Rate limiting (3 req/min by IP)
   - Comprehensive activity logging

3. **Shell Injection Prevention**
   - All user input escaped via `escapeshellarg()`
   - Domain regex validation before processing
   - IP validation via Laravel's `ip` rule
   - Read-only SSH commands

4. **Privacy**
   - Email hashed (SHA-256) in activity logs
   - Anonymous user pattern (no email stored in users table)

---

## üìã Configuration

### Environment Variables

Add to `.env`:

```env
# Simple Unblock Mode
UNBLOCK_SIMPLE_MODE=false
UNBLOCK_SIMPLE_THROTTLE_PER_MINUTE=3
UNBLOCK_SIMPLE_BLOCK_DURATION=15
UNBLOCK_SIMPLE_STRICT_MATCH=true
UNBLOCK_SIMPLE_SILENT_LOG=true
```

### Enable the Feature

1. Set `UNBLOCK_SIMPLE_MODE=true` in `.env`
2. Run seeder: `php artisan db:seed --class=AnonymousUserSeeder`
3. Verify SSH access to log directories
4. Configure admin email in `ADMIN_EMAIL`
