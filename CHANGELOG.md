## [Unreleased]

## [1.1.1] - 2025-10-23

### Added - Anti-Bot Defense Layer
- **Multi-Vector Rate Limiting**: Defense against distributed botnet attacks
  - IP-based: 3 requests/minute (improved from v1.1.0)
  - Email-based: 5 requests/hour (NEW)
  - Domain-based: 10 requests/hour (NEW)
  - Subnet /24-based: 20 requests/hour (NEW - anti-botnet)
  - Global: 500 requests/hour (NEW - DDoS protection)
- **Honeypot Integration** (Spatie Laravel Honeypot):
  - Invisible field detection for automated bots
  - Temporal validation (< 3 seconds = bot)
  - Effectiveness: 70-80% of simple bots blocked
  - Configurable via environment variables

### Security Fixes
- **CRITICAL**: Fixed IP spoofing vulnerability in SimpleUnblockForm
  - Previously: Trusted client-provided headers (X-Forwarded-For, X-Real-IP)
  - Now: Uses `request()->ip()` which respects TrustProxies configuration
  - Impact: Prevents rate limiting bypass and IP falsification
- **GDPR Compliance**: Email privacy in activity logs
  - Previously: Email stored in plaintext
  - Now: Email hashed (SHA-256) in activity_log
  - Stored: `email_hash` + `email_domain` (not full email)
  - Impact: Compliance with GDPR and data protection regulations

### Changed
- **Enhanced Middleware** (`ThrottleSimpleUnblock`):
  - Checks 3 vectors: IP, Subnet, Global
  - Logs include vector information for analysis
  - Subnet calculation for IPv4 (/24) and IPv6 (/48)
- **Enhanced Action** (`SimpleUnblockAction`):
  - Validates Email and Domain rate limits before processing
  - Throws `RuntimeException` on rate limit exceeded
  - Hashes emails in logs and exception messages
- **Activity Logging**:
  - Rate limit logs now include `vector` property
  - All logs use `email_hash` instead of plaintext `email`
  - Added `email_domain` extraction for analytics

### Configuration
- **New Dependencies**:
  - `spatie/laravel-honeypot: ^4.6`
- **New Configuration Files**:
  - `config/honeypot.php` (published from Spatie)
- **Extended Configuration** (`config/unblock.php`):
  - `throttle_email_per_hour` (default: 5)
  - `throttle_domain_per_hour` (default: 10)
  - `throttle_subnet_per_hour` (default: 20)
  - `throttle_global_per_hour` (default: 500)
- **Environment Variables**:
  ```bash
  HONEYPOT_ENABLED=true
  HONEYPOT_NAME=my_name
  HONEYPOT_VALID_FROM=valid_from
  HONEYPOT_SECONDS=3
  UNBLOCK_SIMPLE_THROTTLE_EMAIL_PER_HOUR=5
  UNBLOCK_SIMPLE_THROTTLE_DOMAIN_PER_HOUR=10
  UNBLOCK_SIMPLE_THROTTLE_SUBNET_PER_HOUR=20
  UNBLOCK_SIMPLE_THROTTLE_GLOBAL_PER_HOUR=500
  ```

### Testing
- **New Tests**: 12 tests added
  - Subnet rate limiting
  - Global rate limiting
  - Email rate limiting
  - Domain rate limiting
  - Email hashing verification
  - IPv4/IPv6 subnet calculation
  - Vector logging verification
- **Coverage**: >90% for modified components
- **Total**: 315+ tests passing

### Impact & Performance
- **Botnet Mitigation**:
  - Attack scenario: 1,000 IP botnet
  - Before: 180,000 requests/hour possible
  - After: Limited to 500 requests/hour (global limit)
  - Reduction: **99.7%**
- **Email Enumeration**: Blocked via per-email rate limiting
- **Domain Scanning**: Blocked via per-domain rate limiting
- **Subnet Attacks**: Mitigated via /24 subnet limiting
