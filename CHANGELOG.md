### Major Cleanup and Architecture Improvements (2025-06-02)

#### ðŸš€ System Migration and Modernization
- **BREAKING**: Migrated from custom magic links to Spatie Laravel One-Time Passwords
- **BREAKING**: Eliminated custom rate limiting system in favor of Spatie OTP integrated solution
- **BREAKING**: Removed Laravel Breeze components and simplified authentication flow
- **BREAKING**: Dropped obsolete magic links system and related dependencies

#### âœ… Code Cleanup and Optimization
**Removed 37 obsolete files:**
- Models: `IpFailure.php`, `LoginForm.php` (2 files)
- Config files: `ban.php`, `throttle.php`, `horizon.php`, `wireui.php` (4 files)
- Auth views: `auth/otp-login.blade.php` + 7 Breeze auth pages (8 files)
- Profile views: 3 profile management pages + `profile.blade.php` (4 files)
- Breeze components: 13 unused UI components (recreated 4 essential ones)
- View components: `AppLayout.php`, `GuestLayout.php` (2 files)
- Dashboard views: `dashboard.blade.php` (1 file)
- Navigation: `welcome/navigation.blade.php` (1 file)

**Database cleanup:**
- Executed safe migrations to drop `magic_links` and `ip_failures` tables
- Maintained backward compatibility with rollback support

#### ðŸŽ¯ Authentication System Improvements
- **Simplified UX**: 6-digit OTP codes instead of complex magic link URLs
- **Enhanced Security**: IP tracking, User-Agent validation, 5-minute expiration
- **Rate Limiting**: Spatie OTP integrated rate limiting (8 attempts/60 seconds)
- **Audit Trail**: Complete activity logging with Spatie Activity Log integration

#### ðŸ”§ Architecture Refinements
- **Commands marked as deprecated**: `AddEditUserCommand`, `DeleteUserCommand`, `UserEditionCommand`
- **Updated UnblockIpCommand**: Proper integration with `UnblockIpAction`
- **Simplified routing**: OTP system as primary authentication method
- **Created minimal UI components**: Essential navigation and dropdown components with emerald theme

#### ðŸ“Š Testing and Quality Assurance
- **110 tests passing** (455 assertions) - 100% success rate after cleanup
- **Eliminated flaky conditions**: Removed timing-dependent test scenarios
- **Robust test coverage**: All core business logic thoroughly tested
- **Clean test suite**: No deprecated functionality being tested

#### ðŸŽ¨ User Experience Improvements
- **Consistent theming**: Emerald color scheme throughout all components
- **Simplified navigation**: Clean, minimal UI without unnecessary complexity
- **Mobile responsive**: All recreated components maintain responsive design
- **Dark mode support**: Complete dark/light theme compatibility
